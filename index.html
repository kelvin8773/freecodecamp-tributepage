          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>2000</strong> - He left the firm to launch Stargiving.com, a
            startup that worked to support celebrity-affiliated philanthropy.

            software startup MMF Systems, Inc., as its Vice President and third

            <strong>2005</strong> - Yang left MMF Systems, Inc. to join friend
            Zeke Vanderhoek at a small test preparation company, Manhattan Prep.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>2006</strong> - Vanderhoek asked Yang to take over as CEO.
            While serving as CEO of Manhattan Prep, the company primarily served
            GMAT test preparation becoming the largest U.S. test prep company
            reaching $18 million in annual revenue. The company expanded from 5
            to 27 locations and was eventually acquired by Kaplan, Inc. in
            December 2009, at which point Yang served as the company's President
            through the year 2011.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - Yang founded his new company - Venture of
            America, a non-profit, with the mission "to create economic
            opportunity in American cities by mobilizing the next generation of

            need to create jobs."

            President of the United States in 2020. He is running on the
            campaign slogan "Humanity First", which calls attention to his

            American President of the United State.
